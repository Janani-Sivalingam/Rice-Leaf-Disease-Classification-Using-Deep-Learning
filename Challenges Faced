Limited Access to High-Quality Data:
Data Collection: Obtaining a diverse and comprehensive dataset of rice leaf images with various disease categories can be challenging. Farmers and researchers may not have readily available, high-quality images. Data Annotation: Manually annotating the dataset with accurate disease labels can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when the dataset is large. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:

Noise and Variability: Rice leaf images may contain noise due to inconsistent lighting, background clutter, and varying angles. Augmenting the data to address these issues without introducing artifacts can be challenging. Model Selection and Training:

Choice of Architecture: Selecting an appropriate CNN architecture that can effectively learn and distinguish between different diseases while handling limited data is a crucial decision

Conclusion: Creating a dataset and developing a model for rice leaf disease prediction is a valuable endeavor with the potential to improve agricultural practices.However, it involves overcoming various challenges related to data collection, preprocessing, model training, interpretability, and real-world deployment. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration among researchers, data scientists, and domain experts to create a robust and effective solution for disease prediction in rice plants.
