This project focuses on detecting and classifying diseases in rice leaves using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). By leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques,
the system identifies visual symptoms of major rice plant diseases such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, and leaf smut. The model is trained on labeled leaf images and learns to differentiate
between healthy and infected leaves based on patterns, color, and texture features. This AI-driven approach enables early diagnosis,helping farmers take timely preventive actions to reduce crop loss and improve yield. 
The solution aims to support sustainable agriculture through intelligent, accessible plant health monitoring.
