# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
Problem Statement: 
**Description:**

119 jpg images of various sizes 3 classes -->  brown spot and bacterial leaf blight 40 images per class and leafsmut contains 39 images.
 There are no images of normal rice leaves i.e. not disease infected. According to the paper the leaves were placed against a white background before being photographed.

 There are images in the dataset that appear to have been processed e.g. the background has been removed. Therefore, we have a mixture of raw and processed images.
